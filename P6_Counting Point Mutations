Problem

Figure 2. The Hamming distance between these two strings is 7. Mismatched symbols are colored red.
Given two strings s and t of equal length, the Hamming distance between s
 and t, denoted dH(s,t), is the number of corresponding symbols that differ in s
 and t. See Figure 2.

Given: Two DNA strings s
 and t of equal length (not exceeding 1 kbp).
Return: The Hamming distance dH(s,t)

def hamming_distance(str1, str2):
    if len(str1) != len(str2):
        raise ValueError("Strings must be of the same length")
    return sum(char1 != char2 for char1, char2 in zip(str1, str2))

# Example usage
str1 = input()
str2 = input()
distance = hamming_distance(str1, str2)

print(distance)
